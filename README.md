# Nothing to see here

Although this repo is public, that is just so that I don't have to deal with access control when sharing some of the bits of junk here with various individuals.

The "pg" at the end of "cryptopg" is for "playground". This is sort of a junk folder as I work (or not) on things.

Don't even think of using anything here. Anything possibly worth using will end up on a separate repo.
